# Markup Markdown, rehash Bash, and get the gist

##### Today we want you to get comfortable using Markdown syntax, solidify your understanding of Bash commands, and become acquainted with GitHub gists.

## Setup

Work in any directory of your choosing, but try to name it something sensible such as `classwork`. Tomorrow we will setup your class repo and go over the official homework submission process.

## Part 1
Read the [original Markdown docs](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and then read the [GitHub Flavored Markdown docs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). Do some research about the history of Markdown, starting with Wikipedia. Also read the [Markdown cheatsheet we made for you](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-nyc-bowie_students/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Part 2
Read about Github gists [on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/).

## Part 3
Watch [this TED Talk about grit](http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit?language=en). Create a markdown file called `grit.md` in your working directory from the terminal, and write about your reflections on the video. Make sure to use Markdown syntax, and alter the text/font in ways that _aren't_ covered in the cheatsheet. To check what your Markdown formatting looks like, start a gist, change its language to Markdown, paste your text into the gist, and when you create the gist you will see your text rendered with Markdown. You can edit the gist and see how changing the Markdown syntax changes what the gist looks like.

## Part 4
Make another Markdown file called `bash_cheatsheet.md` in your working directory and make yourself a cheatsheet about Bash commands. At a minimum, include the commands to:

  - create a directory
  - create a file
  - move a file
  - move a directory
  - rename a file
  - rename a directory
  - delete a file
  - delete a directory
  - move around within a directory
  - see what files and directories exist
  - check where in the directory structure you are.

Be as complete as possible and expand on this list; your cheatsheet will be a great resource for you from now on. This is another opportunity to practice Markdown, so include a table, a list (ordered or unordered), and a link.
